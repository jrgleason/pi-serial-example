# Node based Robot API

## Requirements

This is a native project so you will need to install the following requirements.

* GCC
* CMake
* System Headers

I may have forgotten some dependencies, so until I can start back from scratch feel free to PR the project.

## Building

To make just run `npm install`. 

*This will also compile the native portions. Remember without the requirements this may not build properly.*

## Running

To run simply use `npm start`

## Testing

**TODO**
